A collection of documents relating to the City of Saskatoon website redesign project.

# Goal

The goal of this repository is to provide consumer-friendly versions of official City of Saskatoon documents that relate to the recently announced website redesign project.

I will try to keep up to date with adding to this repository during the RFQ and RFP stages of the project in an effort to have a public archive.

It is a personal goal of mine to convince the City of Saskatoon that regardless of who wins the RFP for the city website project, that Markdown should be the format it endorses going forward.

# Why Markdown?

[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is widely used and author/machine friendly; it is easily converted to a number of formats (including, PDF and HTML) via opensource tools like [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/), making it an ideal format for public institutions to store their documents in.
