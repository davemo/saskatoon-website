# WEBSITE REDESIGN PROJECT

## 1.0 General Information

**Vision**

The Website Redesign Project is one of the four year priority items in the City of Saskatoon Strategic Plan [(http://www.sp.saskatooncitynews.ca/)](http://www.sp.saskatooncitynews.ca/).

The overall goal of the Project is the development of a digital strategy that supports the development of a new website, integrates mobile technology into the City's communication and interactions strategies,
and encourages more interaction with the community.

The new website needs to be more customer and Citizen friendly. The design needs to be fluid and must work well on all major devices (e.g., mobile, tablets, desktops, smart TVs). The website needs to be designed to be future-friendly, and it needs to be flexible so that it can grow and change.

Specifically, the City would like to:

* Ensure that the development of a digital strategy that supports the development of a new website, integrates mobile technology into the City's communication and interactions strategies, and
encourages more interaction with the community.

* Ensure that the new website needs to be more customer and citizen friendly.  The design needs to be fluid and must work well on all major devices (e.g., mobile, tablets, desktops, smart TVs).

* Ensure that the new website is designed to be future-friendly. It needs to be flexible so that it is able to grow and change to meet the changing information needs of the community.

* Reorganize the Information Architecture making it a more user-centered and information-based structure.

* Develop a strategy to make it easier for users to search for information they are looking for.

* Provide more opportunities for interaction between the community and the City.

* Expand current eService offerings to augment and improve upon the current offerings.

* Implement a Content Management System that is easy to use and has the ability to make content changes live on the website without a lengthy approval process.

* Ensure support for improved accessibility for the majority of the community.

* Consider alternative techniques for maintaining subsidiary websites.

* Potentially enhance the Corporate Intranet as an optional aspect of this project.

**Invitation** 

The City of Saskatoon, herein referred to as the City, is undertaking a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) from qualified consulting firms to:

Redesign the current website using:

* many of the [recommendations](http://www.saskatoon.ca/DEPARTMENTS/City%20Managers%20Office/Communications%20Branch/Documents/CityOfSaskatoon_Website%20ResearchReport%20October%2031%202012_FINAL_small.pdf) outlined in the Phase I Project report; and

* [input](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aYAoGxlP9jUfpvrukqdVYuTZIOi9QdO4YyBreE8EP1E/edit) provided from the Saskatoon software development community.

* Reorganize the Information Architecture making it a more user-centered and information-based structure.

* Advise on a broad digital strategy and how the consultant proposes this integrates into the new website.

* Gather the detailed requirements of users and stakeholders and define implementation priorities for phased delivery.

* Assist with the migration of current website content to a new Content Management System (CMS), and design and implement new features based on the identified requirements.

* Design and implement the business processes required to maintain the website on an ongoing basis.

**Objective**

The objective of this Request for Qualifications (RFQ) is to short-list up to five (5) Consultants to be invited to participate in the Request for Proposal (RFP) for the development of a digital strategy that supports the development of a new website, integrates mobile technology into the City's communication and interactions strategies, and encourages more interaction with the community.

This RFQ is not a tender, an offer, or a request for proposals, and there is no intention by the City to make an offer by issuing this RFQ.

All technical questions concerning the RFQ should be directed (preferably via email) to:

## 2.0 Project Information

**Background**

The City of Saskatoon website is a key communication and business tool for its citizens, City staff, and elected officials. Saskatoon.ca creates an identity for the municipality and provides information and services to more than 107,000 people annually. It has been some time since the last redesign, and the website is no longer able to meet the needs of its users.

The City currently hosts the website internally on a SharePoint platform. There are over 1,300 pages on the website and over 100 staff involved in creating and maintaining content on the system. The City is interested in exploring all options that can handle traffic spikes, such as a cloud-based service.

In 2012, Phase I of this project gathered information through a website audit and focus testing process, and provided recommendations, rationale and impact, and proposed an initial concept and project plan that will
be the foundation for the website redesign.

Some of the issues with Saskatoon.ca identified in the report include:

* Information is not easy to find, due to a poorly organized and overcrowded navigation system that is overwhelming to users.

* eServices, such as the real-time maps and schedules, traffic camera information, and issues reporting tool, are either not available or not functioning as intended.

* Information flow within the website is only from the City to its citizens, but not vice-versa.

* The website does not enable any social interaction between the City employees and the citizens of Saskatoon and is therefore missing an opportunity for more transparency and dialogue.

* The current Content Management System (CMS) and strategy are insufficient for the needs of the City employees.

* As a result of its out-of-date design, Saskatoon.ca has limited accessibility for citizens with disabilities.

* It is not optimized for access through new devices, such as mobile Smartphones and tablets.

The City would like to partner with a Consultant to accomplish the following:

* The development of a digital strategy that supports the development of a new website, integrates mobile technology into the City's communication and interactions strategies, and encourages more interaction with the community.

* The new website needs to be more customer and citizen-friendly. The design needs to be fluid and must work well on all major devices (e.g., mobile, tablets, desktops, smart TVs).

* The new website also needs to be designed to be future-friendly. It needs to be flexible so that it is able to grow and change to meet the changing information needs of the community.

* Reorganize the Information Architecture making it a more user-centered and information-based structure.

* Develop a strategy to make it easier for users to search for information they are looking for.

* Provide more opportunities for interaction between the community and the City.

* Expand current eService offerings to augment and improve upon the current offerings.

* Implement a Content Management System that is easy to use and has the ability to make content changes live on the website without a lengthy approval process.

* Ensure support for improved accessibility for the majority of the community.

* Consider alternative techniques for maintaining subsidiary websites.

* Potentially enhance the Corporate Intranet as an optional aspect of this project.

**Some Success Criteria**

The Phase I Report established the following as measures of success for
a redesigned Saskatoon.ca:

* Saskatoon.ca is the authoritative source for civic information.

* The majority of information is accessed from anywhere on the website within three (3) clicks.

* Initial information loads within the browser in five (5) seconds or less.

* Information is readable and legible to all audiences on a wide variety of devices.

* Direct interaction with citizens and third parties is increased, resulting in a greater feeling of transparency and responsiveness by the City.

* Citizen web services expand, augmenting traditional customer service representatives and resulting in a measureable perception by citizens of a more responsive government.

**Procurement Process** 

The procurement of services to undertake the Website Redesign Project will proceed in two steps: a Request for Qualifications (RFQ), and a Request for Proposals (RFP).

_Request for Qualifications_

The Request for Qualifications (RFQ) will seek statements of qualifications from interested firms. Firms submitting an RFQ will henceforth be referred to as "Consultants." The term "Consultant" is intended to include all firms that are part of the submitting team.

The purpose of the RFQ is to enable the City to short-list qualified Consultants for further consideration. The RFQ includes a listing of the evaluation criteria to be used by the City to evaluate the submissions.

Evaluation of the submissions will determine which Consultants have the organizational capacity, technical and financial capability to provide services, and perform the contract to achieve the objectives of the City. Past working experiences and expertise will be taken into consideration.

No more than five Consultants will be selected, and only those Consultants short-listed will be invited to respond to the subsequent RFP.

A copy of the Phase I Report is available on the City of Saskatoon website to assist the Consultants in assembling a project team for the RFQ submission. Look under W in the A to Z listing for Website
Project.

_Request for Proposals_ 

The Request for Proposals (RFP) will seek detailed proposals from the short-listed Consultants. The City will complete a review of each Consultant's proposal to ensure all submissions meet the requirements of the RFP. Since all Consultants will be considered qualified, the selection criteria will be focused on project requirements, resource allocation, methodology, innovation, and cost.

_Target Dates_

The following are the key milestones and tentative project times which are subject to change:

* Project Start Date: September 2013

* Visual Design Phase Completion: Mid-November 2013

* Technical Design Phase Completion: Mid-December 2013

* Construction, Testing, and Deployment Completion: August 2014

## 3.0 Submission Guidelines 

The main body of the RFQ submission shall be no longer than three (3) pages, excluding attachments, and shall be separated from any supplemental information.

Resumes of the key project members and their availability are critical along with their project experience (in conjunction with corporate experience).

Submissions will be evaluated and ranked by a committee in order to short-list Consultants. The selected Consultants will then be requested to prepare a detailed proposal.

The objective of this Request for Qualifications (RFQ) is to short-list up to five (5) consultants to be invited to participate in the Request for Proposal (RFP) for the project.

The City is not requesting a detailed work plan until Consultants are pre-qualified and requested to prepare a detailed proposal.

**Required Information**

Ten (10) copies of the RFQ are to be submitted in a sealed package clearly marked with Website Redesign Project RFQ, closing date and time, and address to and from.

Submissions received after the closing date and time will not be evaluated and will be returned unopened. Delivery service disruptions will not be acceptable conditions for late submissions. The RFQ document shall include the following information:

1. General

  * The name, address, telephone number, and email address of the Lead Consultant.
  * Identification of all Sub-Consultant(s).

2. Project Team

  * Consultants shall identify and provide availability of management staff and key personnel who will be responsible for design and implementation of the anticipated contract, as well as their roles in the project.
  * The successful proponent must have one key member from the project team available to meet with the Steering Committee in Saskatoon on reasonable notice.
  * The RFQ must identify which Sub-Consultants or specialist services will be used and what their role will be. Sub-Consultants and their work must be totally integrated into the Project Team.
    * Provide educational background, experience, and other relevant information for the Project Manager and the Project Team.
      * Key attributes of the Team should include:
        * Expertise and understanding of service platform.
        * Web services planning, development, and implementation.
        * Proposed design partnerships or the in-house design team that is available to the project. This should be people with digital media experience and not only graphic designers.
        * Website governance.
        * Project management and leadership.
        * Relevant work experience (especially in the area of responsive website design for access by mobile devices).
        * CMS software expertise.
        * Solid communication and facilitation skills.
        * Community and stakeholder engagement experience.

3. Related Project Experience and References

  * Consultants shall provide past experience to assignments of similar scope and complexity carried out by the firm, management staff, and key personnel. Key project staff involvement in each of the projects with their role in the project should be highlighted.
  * Consultants shall provide references for similar work completed for other communities or large corporations. The City may contact these individuals to discuss their experience with your firm, your Project Team, and any Sub-Consultants.

4. Project Overview

  * Consultants shall provide a brief overview of: 
    * their understanding of the project requirements; and
    * anticipated methods and technical approach that they intend to implement if chosen to work on this project.

**Evaluation Criteria**

The evaluation will be carried out by the Project Steering Committee with assistance from other persons as the City may decide it requires, including technical, financial, legal, and other advisors or employees of the City.

Project Steering Committee Members include:

* Rob Gilhuly, Website Design Project Manager, Communications Branch, City Managers Office
* Dr. Aaron Genest, Saskatoon Resident
* Dale Neufeld, Saskatoon Resident
* Carla Blumers, Communications Branch Manager, City Managers Office

To assist in the evaluation, the City may, in its discretion, but is not
required to:

1. conduct reference checks relevant to the Project with any or all references cited to verify any and all information regarding a Consultant, inclusive of its directors/officers and key individuals;

2. conduct any other reference checks or conduct any background investigations and/or seek any additional information that it considers necessary;

3. request interviews/presentations with any, some, or all Consultants to clarify any questions or considerations based on the information included in the submissions or seek any supplementary information; and

4. rely on and consider any information obtained as a result of such reference checks, background investigations, requests for clarification or supplementary information, interviews/presentations, and/or any additional information in the evaluation of submissions.

The City is not obligated to complete a detailed evaluation of all submissions and may, at its discretion, after completing a preliminary review of all the submissions, discontinue detailed investigation of any Consultant who, when compared to the other Consultants, the City deems is not in contention to be short-listed.

The City will notify Consultants informing them of whether they will be invited to participate in the RFP stage or not.

**Changes to Consultant Teams**

The City intends to issue the RFP only to Consultants that have been short-listed under this RFQ as Proponents for the RFP process. The Consultant must submit a written application to the City for approval, if for any reason after the RFQ Submission time a Consultant wishes or requires to:

1. add, remove or otherwise change a member of its Consultant Team, or there is a material change in ownership or control of a member of the Consultant Team, or 

2. if there is a change to the legal relationship among any or all of the Consultant Team members.

3. The written application must include supporting information that may assist the City in evaluating the change.

The City, in its discretion, may grant or refuse an application under this Section, and in exercising its discretion, the City will consider the objective of achieving a Competitive Selection Process that is not unfair to the other Consultants. For example:

1. if the application is made after the Proponents have been determined, the Authority may refuse to permit a change to the membership of a Consultant Team if the change would, in the City's judgment, result in a weaker team than was originally short-listed; or

2. the City may, in the exercise of its discretion, permit any changes to a Respondent Team, including changes as may be requested arising from changes in ownership or control of a Consultant Team member, or changes to the legal relationship among the Consultant Team members such as the creation of a new joint venture or other legal entity or relationship in place of the Consultant Team.

The City's approval may include such terms and conditions as the City considers appropriate.

This Section shall apply until issuance of the RFP.

If the Consultant is selected as a Proponent, there are restrictions on
changing these key individuals without the City's approval.

**No Obligation to Proceed**

This RFQ does not commit the City in any way to proceed to an RFP stage or award a contract. The City reserves the complete right to, at any time, reject all responses and to terminate the Competitive Selection Process established by this RFQ and proceed with the Project in any other manner as the City may decide in its discretion.

**Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act**

All documents and other records in the custody of, or under the control of, the Authority are subject to *The Local Authority Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act*("FOIPPA") and other applicable legislation.
