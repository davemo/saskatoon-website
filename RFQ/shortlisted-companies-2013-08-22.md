Hello {Proponent}, thank you for your response to the above RFQ and for your interest in our project.  Your submission was one of 19 that our Steering Committee had to review.

Your proposal was carefully evaluated using the evaluation criteria and weighting system outlined in the RFQ document.  The Steering Committee completed their evaluation process and determined the top five submissions that will be invited to participate in the RFP process.

The following five (5) Consultants had the highest scoring submissions and will be invited to participate in the RFP submissions process:

- [Atomic Crayon](http://atomiccrayon.com/), Victoria, BC.
- [eSolutions Group](http://www.esolutionsgroup.ca/en/), Waterloo, ON.
- [Intelliware software development](http://www.intelliware.com/), Toronto, ON.
- [IBM Global Business Services](http://www-03.ibm.com/services/ca/en/), Regina, SK.
- [Zu](http://www.zu.com), Saskatoon, SK.

We appreciated the effort you and your colleagues put into your submissions.  If you are interested in setting up an appointment for a short debrief on your submission's evaluation review, please email me a few days/times that are convenient for me to call you in the next few weeks.  I have some high level notes on what areas your submission scored well on, and what areas you could have improved on.

Thank you once again for your interest in our project.
