## Project Approach

After analyzing the Request For Qualifications and the Website Research Report completed in October of 2012 for the City of Saskatoon, we feel that a partnership approach between Test Double and Island would provide the City of Saskatoon with a cost efficient, user-centered website that is extensible and maintainable for years to come.

Test Double is a custom software development studio that loves solving complex problems with simple solutions. This results in the highest level of quality and the lowest possible cost for our clients. Test Double would be responsible for project management, custom software development, and automation of content migration.

Island is a design studio focused on crafting great digital experiences. We practice a user-centered design approach that ensures the products we create satisfy all user needs, while still meeting business goals. Island would be responsible for project strategy, user experience (UX) design, and user testing.

Instead of lengthy visual and technical design phases, an iterative approach to software development will be used to ensure that the City of Saskatoon receives production level software as soon as possible. This will allow team members, stakeholders, and end users to provide feedback to the team on areas of the website as it is being developed. Difficult challenges in migrating the solution to production will be uncovered in the early stages of the project instead of postponed until the very end, thereby mitigating the riskiest areas of the project at its earliest stages.

Stakeholders will be encouraged to direct the development team towards the most valuable features and requirements of the system every iteration. The continuous planning that occurs during these 1-2 week cycles will provide stakeholders with every opportunity to change the priority of features, add new features, and remove features that are determined to be of little value.

We understand that SharePoint is already in use at the City of Saskatoon and that prior vendors have recommended its continued use and expansion into the public facing portions of the website. We, however, disagree. Leveraging SharePoint for an extensive and largely custom website would be extremely costly in terms of construction, customization, staffing, licensing, and long term maintenance. For example, one area of interest within the RFQ was Search Engine Optimization. One aspect of improving a website&rsquo;s ranking in a search engine is using user friendly URLs like [http://www.saskatoon.ca/leisure/parks](http://www.saskatoon.ca/leisure/parks). In SharePoint 2007 and 2010, this was accomplished as a manual written extension of SharePoint or IIS itself. As future versions of SharePoint are used, these custom modules need to be re-tested, modified, or in some cases completely re-written. This is but one example of the many customizations that will face the City of Saskatoon if SharePoint is leveraged as a platform for the city's website. The collective cost of each of these extensions will continue to cause monetary, performance, and quality issues for the city.

In lieu of SharePoint, we recommend an approach that leans on open source technology consisting of open standards like Markdown, Git, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS as the foundation. Specifically, our recommendation is to craft a simple, static website (without a database) utilizing a custom static-site generator that can convert the Markdown format into HTML. Markdown offers a simple, easy-to-use syntax that will allow city employees to craft and preview updates to the website without significant overhead. This approach is similar to those used by other recently completed, high-profile government websites: [gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/) and [healthcare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/). Our approach has the advantage of avoiding a whole range of constraints and performance issues that typically plague database-driven web applications including query caching, data replication and other deployment issues. Our approach is flexible and also supports the integration of existing data API's and services using JSONP and/or a simple proxy server.

With regards to the migration of content, we believe our approach will allow for a custom PDF to Markdown translator to be used to migrate the vast majority of existing content. Where there are errors, omissions, or changes desired, we recommend that the City of Saskatoon hire or employ someone to manually edit the areas of the page where appropriate. This will allow the city to provide a level of quality assurance across each area of the website.

## Project Team

**Project Manager** - The project manager for this engagement will lead coordination and scheduling of relevant stakeholder meetings, planning sessions, and generally provide visibility of the project under development to stakeholders. We do not believe this is a full time role however, so we are leveraging Todd Kaufman who can split time between project management and development due to his diverse background.

**Developers** - We believe the project team will require a total of four developers.Test Double will provide four open source focused developers with over 15 years experience each in software delivery. They will be lead by David Mosher, but will also include Tim Wingfield, Michael Kramer, and Todd Kaufman.

**Designers** - Island will use two designers on this project. Dustin Weeres will act as lead design on the project and Amanda Gibbs will work under his direction. Together they bring over 20 years experience in design and have worked on large-scale projects for clients such as Cameco, TransCanada, The Cooper Companies, PotashCorp and Government of Saskatchewan.

## Related Experience

[Comverge SmartConsumer](http://www.comverge.com/utilities/SmartConsumer)

Comverge SmartConsumer is a residential customer engagement solution designed to increase energy awareness among utility customers and inspire them to use electricity more efficiently. Test Double contracted Saskatoon based developers David Mosher and Kevin Baribeau to build this mobile-optimized responsive web-application in just three months.

Government of Saskatchewan

As a Designer at zu (zu.com), Dustin provided the initial strategy and UX design for a yet to be launched Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority redesign which included a catalog of the various alcohol to order as well as recipes that related to the respective alcohol.

[Remai Art Gallery of Saskatchewan](http://remai.ca/)

The Remai Art Gallery is a new art gallery to be built in Saskatoon in 2015. A capital campaign website was required to promote the new gallery and generate donations in order to help them successfully reach their fundraising goals. Island provided social media strategy, website strategy and architecture as well as UX design.

Meewasin Valley Authority

Island worked with another firm to redesign the MVA website. The new website is fully responsive and is to be launched in September 2013. The new website improves the communication channels between the visitors and the MVA by allowing users to provide feedback on news and events as well as ads more prominence to areas like donation methods and development within the Meewasin Valley.
